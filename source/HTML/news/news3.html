<p>KIGALI, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda's National Commission for the Fight against Genocide (CNLG) on Friday described as a "landmark" the conviction of a former Rwandan official by the Brussels High Court on Thursday for genocide and war crimes.</p>
<p>Fabien Neretse, 71, was sentenced on Friday to 25 years in prison by the Belgian court following Thursday's conviction.</p>
<p>He was prosecuted for genocide and war crimes committed during the three-month Rwandan genocide against Tutsi minority in 1994, which claimed the lives of over 1 million people.</p>
<p>Neretse, who denied all charges during the trial, is the first person to be convicted in Belgium on a genocide charge, said the CNLG in a statement.</p>
<p>Magistrates of Belgium had been compiling evidence of the case over the years since Neretse was arrested in France in 2011.</p> </li></ul><a href="/page1"><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Return to homepage</button></a><script src="../../JS/jquery.js"></script><script src="../../JS/jQuery_Color_Animations.js"></script><script src="../../JS/bootstrap.js"></script></body></html>
