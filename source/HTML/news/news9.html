Once known for its large deposits of coal, the resource-depleted city is pursuing a greener path forward.</strong><br /></p>
<p class="">SHENYANG, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- Fuxin, once known for its rich coal resources, is putting the pedal to the metal in developing its motor racing industry as the resource-depleted city seeks to build new economic pillars.<br /></p>
<p class="">"It's simply amazing," said Gu Zhijian, a racer who came to Fuxin in northeast China's Liaoning Province for the grand final of the 2019 China Offroad Championship. He was deeply impressed by the racetrack built in an abandoned mine pit.</p>
<p class="">Around 150 km away from Liaoning's capital Shenyang, Fuxin converted an abandoned mine pit into a racecourse in late 2018. So far, the city has hosted eight races for off-road vehicles, attracting over 300,000 spectators in total.</p></li></ul><a href="/page1"><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Return to homepage</button></a><script src="../../JS/jquery.js"></script><script src="../../JS/jQuery_Color_Animations.js"></script><script src="../../JS/bootstrap.js"></script></body></html>
